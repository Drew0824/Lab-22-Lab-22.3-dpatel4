# Using for loops with an array

## Step 1
Examine and run the code to see how it functions. Add a comment to the code each time the **grades** array is used, describing what that line of code is doing. You should have at least **4** comments added.

## Step 2
Modify the code to process **4** array elements instead of 5.

## Step 3
Add statements to also calculate the average of the 4 elements inputted and display the average to the screen.
